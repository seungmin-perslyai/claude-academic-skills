# Academic Critique Checklist

This checklist guides the generation of counterarguments across five key dimensions. For each claim or argument, systematically evaluate potential weaknesses in each category.

## 1. Methodological Limitations

Questions to identify weaknesses:
- Is the sample size adequate for the conclusions drawn?
- Are control variables properly accounted for?
- Could confounding variables explain the results?
- Are the measurement instruments valid and reliable?
- Is the experimental design appropriate for the research question?
- Are statistical methods applied correctly?
- Could selection bias affect the results?
- Are alternative explanations ruled out adequately?

## 2. Generalizability

Questions to identify weaknesses:
- Is the sample representative of the broader population?
- Do findings apply across different contexts, cultures, or settings?
- Are temporal constraints limiting the applicability?
- Do results hold across different demographic groups?
- Are boundary conditions clearly specified?
- Could the findings be specific to the study environment?
- Are claims about universality justified?

## 3. Overstated Claims

Questions to identify weaknesses:
- Do conclusions exceed what the data actually support?
- Are causal claims made from correlational data?
- Is certainty expressed where uncertainty exists?
- Are limitations downplayed or omitted?
- Is the practical significance overstated relative to statistical significance?
- Are qualifiers (e.g., "may", "suggests") appropriately used?
- Does the abstract or conclusion overreach beyond the findings?

## 4. Missing Comparisons

Questions to identify weaknesses:
- Are relevant baseline or control conditions absent?
- Are alternative approaches or theories not considered?
- Is prior work inadequately compared?
- Are competing explanations not addressed?
- Is the novelty claim justified without proper comparison?
- Are relevant benchmarks or standards missing?
- Are effect sizes not contextualized against existing literature?

## 5. Reproducibility Concerns

Questions to identify weaknesses:
- Are procedures described in sufficient detail for replication?
- Are materials and instruments clearly specified?
- Is the data or code available for verification?
- Are analysis steps fully documented?
- Could computational results be reproduced from the description?
- Are random seeds or other reproducibility elements specified?
- Are dependencies and versions clearly stated?
- Could independent researchers replicate the study?
